## 21. FORWARD

A forward instruction overrides the default files that are used for inputs to the next pipeline stage with files that you specify explicitly. You can provide a hard coded file name, but ideally you will pass files that are based on the input or output implicit variables that Bpipe creates automatically so that your pipeline stage remains generic.

Bpipe uses heuristics to select the correct output from a pipeline stage that would be passed forward by default to the next stage as an input (assuming the next stage doesn't specify any constraints about what kind of input it wants). Sometimes however, the output from a pipeline stage is not usually wanted by following stages or Bpipe's logic selects the wrong output. In these cases it is useful to override the default with your own logic to specify which output should become the default.

```
bpipe run forward.groovy *.bam

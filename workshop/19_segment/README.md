## 19. SEGMENT

Defines a reusable segment of a pipeline that can be made up of multiple pipeline stages. The segment then behaves just like a normal pipeline stage itself. This statement is useful when you have a commonly reoccurring sequence of pipeline stages that you wish to use multiple times in your pipelines, or even multiple times in a single pipeline.

```
bpipe run segment.groovy
```

## 4. EXEC

A minimal pipeline is composed by:

1. one or more stages
2. A "run" closure (the pipeline)

Each stage contains an *exec* command that runs the command in a bash shell.

Long commands that are passed to exec can be specified over multiple lines by using triple quotes. 

Bpipe automatically removes newlines from commands so that you do not need to worry about it.

An exec statement will often be embedded in a produce, filter or transform block to specify and manage the outputs of the command.

All commands executed via exec are automatically added to the command history for the run.

If the command fails or is interrupted (by Ctrl-C or kill), the pipeline will be automatically terminated. Any outputs specified as generated by the stage running the exec command will be marked as dirty and moved to the local bpipe trash folder.


```
cd 4_exec
bpipe run helloworld.groovy
bpipe run exec.groovy
```

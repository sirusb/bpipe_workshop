Dear bpipe user,<br/>

<b>$date</b> your pipeline at path <em>$full_path</em> fired the event:

<pre>$event : $description</pre>

Your output and intermediate files are here: <pre>$full_path</pre>

By default Bpipe sticks to sending plain text notifications.
However if you name your template ending with ".html", Bpipe will change the content type to "text/html" so that an HTML email is sent instead.

At this stage you cannot embed images, although you can reference remote images:

Like this fantastic "Epic Pirate" from the original Microsoft Clip arts...
